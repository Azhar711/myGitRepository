   <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong><br />
     AmeriHealth Caritas DC takes our members’   right to privacy seriously. In order to provide you with your benefits, AmeriHealth Caritas DC creates and/or receives personal information about your health. This   information comes from you, your physicians, hospitals, and other health care   services providers. This information can be oral, written, or electronic.   AmeriHealth Caritas DC must keep this information confidential. We have set up ways to   make sure that all personal health information is used correctly. For example,   all AmeriHealth Caritas DC employees must sign and follow the Company’s Confidentiality   Policy. Another example is all company computers are password protected and   equipped with security protection devices. This notice of our privacy practices   is intended to explain how we may use your health information. It will also   explain when we may disclose this information to others.</p>
   <p>Occasionally, we may use members’ information when providing treatment. We   use members’ health information to provide benefits. We provide members’   information to health care providers to help them treat members or to help them   receive payment. We may provide information to other insurance companies as   necessary to receive payment. We may use the information within our organization   to evaluate quality and improve health care operations. We may make other uses   and disclosures of members’ information as the law requires or as AmeriHealth Caritas DC policies permit.</p>
   <p><strong>KINDS OF INFORMATION THAT THIS NOTICE APPLIES TO</strong><br />
     This   notice covers any information we have that would allow someone to identify you   and learn something about your health. It does not apply to information that   cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>
   <p><strong>WHO MUST FOLLOW THIS NOTICE</strong></p>
   <ul>
     <li>AmeriHealth Caritas DC. </li>
     <li>All employees, staff, interns, volunteers and other personnel whose work is   under direct control of AmeriHealth Caritas DC. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>We may share your information within the company for treatment purposes and,   as necessary, for payment and operations activities as described below.</p>
   <p><strong>OUR LEGAL DUTIES</strong></p>
   <ul>
     <li>The law requires that we maintain the privacy of your health information. </li>
     <li>We are required to provide this Notice of Privacy Practices and legal duties   regarding health information to you. </li>
     <li>We are required to follow the terms of this notice until we officially adopt   a new notice. </li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>HOW WE MAY USE OR DISCLOSE YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION</strong><br />
     We may   use your health information, or provide it to others, for many different   reasons. This notice describes these reasons. For each reason, we provide a   brief explanation. We also give some examples. These examples do not include all   of the specific ways we may use or disclose your information. But any time we   use your information, or provide it to others, it will fit one of the reasons   listed here.</p>
   <ol>
     <li><strong>Treatment.</strong> We may use your health information to provide   you with medical care and services. This means that our employees, staff,   interns, volunteers and others whose work is under our direct control, may read   your health information. They may do this to learn about your medical condition   and use it to help you make decisions about your care. For instance, one of our   nurses may take your blood pressure at a health fair. We may also provide your   information to others to help them provide you with medical treatment or   services. For example, we may use health information to identify members with   certain chronic illnesses. We may then send information to them, or to their   doctors, regarding treatment alternatives. We will not use or provide more   information for treatment purposes than is necessary. </li>
     <li><strong>Payment.</strong> We may use your health information, and provide it   to others, to make payment for the health care services you receive. For   instance, a claims processing employee may use your health information to pay   your claims. We may send information about you and your claim payments to the   doctor or hospital that provided health care services to you. We will also send   information about claims we pay and claims we do not pay (called an “explanation   of benefits”) to you. The explanation of benefits will include claim information   we receive for you or your family member(s). Sometimes, you may receive this   information confidentially (see the “Confidential Communication” section in this   notice). We may also provide some of your health information to companies that   we contract with for paymentrelated services. For instance, we may give   information about you to a claims processing&lt; company that we contract with   to pay claims. We will not use or provide more information for payment purposes   than is necessary. </li>
     <li><strong>Health Care Operations.</strong> We may use your health information   for activities that are necessary to operate our organization. This includes,   for example, reading your health information to review our staff’s performance.   We may also use members’ information to plan what services we need to provide,   expand, or reduce. We may provide your health information to others who we   contract with for administrative services. This includes our lawyers, auditors,   accreditation services, and consultants. We will not use or disclose more   information for operational purposes than is necessary. </li>
     <li><strong>Business Associates. </strong>We perform certain aspects and   components of our services through contracts with outside persons or   organizations. This includes auditing, legal services, etc. At times it may be   necessary for us to provide some of your personal health information to one or   more of these outside persons or organizations who assist us with our   payment/billing activities and health care operations. In such cases, we require   these business associates to protect the privacy of your information. </li>
     <li><strong>Legal Requirement to Disclose Information. </strong>We will provide   your information to others when the law requires that we do so. This includes   reporting information to government agencies that have the legal responsibility   to monitor the health care system. For instance, we may be required to provide   your health information, and the information of others, if the state insurance   or health department audits us. We will also provide your health information   when a court order or other judicial or administrative process requires that we   do so. </li>
     <li><strong>Public Health Activities.</strong> We will provide your health   information when public health purposes require that we do so. This includes   reporting certain diseases, births, deaths, and reactions to certain   medications. It may also include notifying people who have been exposed to a   disease. </li>
     <li><strong>To Report Abuse. </strong>We may provide your health information   when the information relates to an abuse, neglect or domestic violence victim.   We will make this report only if there are laws that require or allow such   reporting (or with your permission). </li>
     <li><strong>Law Enforcement.</strong> We may provide your health information for   law enforcement purposes. This includes providing information to help locate a   suspect, fugitive, material witness or missing person. It also includes   information in connection with suspected criminal activity. We must provide your   health information to a federal agency reviewing our compliance with federal   privacy regulations. </li>
     <li><strong>Specialized Purposes.</strong> We may provide your health   information for other specialized purposes. We will only provide as much   information as is necessary for the purpose. For example, we may provide the   health information of Armed Forces members as authorized by military command   authorities. In addition, we may give your information to coroners, medical   examiners and funeral directors. We may provide it to organ procurement   organizations (for organ, eye, or tissue donation). We may provide it for   national security, intelligence, and protection of the&lt; President. We also   may provide health information about an inmate to a correctional institution or   to law enforcement officials. We would do this to provide the inmate with health   care, to protect the health and safety of the inmate and others, and for the   safety, administration, and maintenance of the correctional institution. </li>
     <li><strong>To Avert a Serious Threat.</strong> We may disclose your health   information if we decide that the disclosure is necessary to prevent serious   harm to the public or to an individual. The disclosure will only be made to   someone who is able to prevent or reduce such a threat. </li>
     <li><strong>Persons Involved In Your Care.</strong> We may provide your health   information to a family member or someone else who is involved in your medical   care or care payment. This may include telling a family member about the status   of a claim, or what benefits you are eligible to receive. In the event of a   disaster, we may provide information about you to a disaster relief organization   so your family can be notified of your condition and location. We will not   provide your information to family or friends if you object. </li>
     <li><strong>Research.</strong> We may provide your health information in   connection with medical research projects. Federal rules govern any disclosure   of your health information for research purposes without your authorization. </li>
     <li><strong>To Provide Information to You. </strong>We may use your health   information to provide you with additional information. This may include sending   appointment reminders to your address. This may also include giving you   information about treatment options, alternative setting for care, or other   services that we provide or arrange for you. </li>
   </ol>
   <p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>
   <ol>
     <li><strong>Authorization.</strong> We may use or provide your health   information for any purpose listed in this notice without your written   authorization. We will not use or provide your health information for any other   reason without your authorization. If you authorize us to use or provide your   health information, you can cancel the authorization at any time. For   information about how to authorize us to use or disclose your health   information, or about how to cancel an authorization, please see the “Whom to   Contact” section at the end of this notice. You may not cancel an authorization   for us to use and provide your information if we have taken action in reliance   on the authorization. If the authorization allows us to provide your information   to an insurance company as a condition of obtaining coverage, other laws may   allow the insurer to continue to use your information to contest claims or your   coverage, even after you have canceled the authorization. </li>
     <li><strong>Request Restrictions.</strong> You have the right to ask us to   restrict or limit how we use or provide your health information. We will   consider your request, but we are not required to agree to it. If we do agree,   we will comply with the request unless the information is needed to provide you   with emergency treatment. We cannot agree to limit disclosures that the law   requires. </li>
     <li><strong>Confidential Communication.</strong> If you believe that the   disclosure of certain information could endanger you, you have the right to ask   us in writing to communicate with you at a special address or by a special   means. For example, you may ask us to send explanations of benefits that contain   your health information to a different address rather than to your home. Or you   may ask us to speak to you personally on the telephone rather than sending your   health information by mail. We will agree to any reasonable request. </li>
     <li><strong>Inspect and Receive a Copy of Health Information.</strong> You have   a right to inspect your health information that we have in our records, and to   receive a copy of it. This right is limited to your information that is used to   make decisions about you. For instance, this includes claim and enrollment   records. If you want to review or receive a copy of these records, you must make   the request in writing. We may charge you a fee for the cost of copying and   mailing the records. To ask to inspect your records, or to receive a copy, see   the “Whom to Contact” section at the end of this notice. We will respond to your   request within 30 days. We may deny you access to certain information. If we do,   we will give you the reason in writing. We will also explain how you may appeal   the decision. </li>
     <li><strong>Amend Health Information. </strong>You have the right to ask us to   amend health information about you that you believe is not correct, or not   complete. You must make this request in writing. You must also give us the   reason you believe the information is not correct or complete. We will respond   to your request in writing within 30 days. We may deny your request if we did   not create the information, if it is not part of the records we use to make   decisions about you, if the information is something you would not be permitted   to inspect or copy, or if it is complete and accurate. </li>
     <li><strong>Accounting of Disclosures. </strong>You have a right to receive an   accounting of certain disclosures of your information to others. This accounting   will list the times we have given your health information to others. The list   will include the disclosure dates, the names of the people or organizations to   whom the information was provided, an information description, and the reason.   We will provide the first list of disclosures you request at no charge. We may   charge you for any additional lists you request during the following 12 months.   You must tell us the time period you want the list to cover. You may not request   a time period longer than seven years. We cannot include disclosures made before   May 1, 2013. Disclosures for the following reasons will not be included on   the list:
       <ul>
         <li>Disclosures for treatment, payment, or health care operations </li>
         <li>Disclosures for national security purposes </li>
